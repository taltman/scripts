### Make configuration:
## Use Bash as default shell, and in strict mode:
SHELL := /bin/bash
.SHELLFLAGS = -ec

## If the parent env doesn't ste TMPDIR, do it ourselves:
TMPDIR ?= /tmp


## This makes all recipe lines execute within a shared shell process:
## https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/One-Shell.html#One-Shell
.ONESHELL:

## If a recipe contains an error, delete the target:
## https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Special-Targets.html#Special-Targets
.DELETE_ON_ERROR:

## This is necessary to make sure that these intermediate files aren't clobbered:
.SECONDARY: $(chromosomes-vcf-path)
