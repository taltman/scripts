#### genbank_chopper.sh
##
##   Split a multi-contig GenBank-formatted annotation (and 
##   possibly also sequence) file into a set of 
##   per-contig GenBank-formatted files. Also, generate the 
##   genetic-elements.dat index file for the set of files, as
##   needed as input for PathoLogic.
##
## Inspired by data processing of a sponge draft genome for Cara Fiore,
## WHOI, at STAMPS, MBL, 2014

### Synopsys:
##
## genbank_chopper.sh [file prefix] [path to GenBank annotation file] [decimal places]

### Example:
##
## genbank_chopper.sh E-coli-K12-MG1655- e_coli_k12_acc_num_12345.gbk 5

### Arguments
##
## file prefix:
## A common prefix for all of the generated files. It needs to only 
## include alphanumeric characters or hyphens.
##
## path to GenBank annotation file:
## Filesystem path to the multi-contig GenBank-formatted annotation
## (and possibly sequence ) file.
##
## decimal places:
## An integer representing how many decimal places should be used for 
## the incrementing portion of the output GenBank-formatted file names.

### Output:
##
## A set of GenBank-formatted files, one per contig in the input 
## GenBank-formatted file. Also, a Pathway Tools PathoLogic 
## genetic-elements.dat file will be generated.
##
## An example of an output GenBank-formatted file name:
## E-coli-K12-MG1655-00001.gbk
##
## An example genetic-elements.dat file can be found here:
